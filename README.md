### Working on the DriverPass project helped me understand how system design works in a real scenario. The client was DriverPass, and they wanted a web-based system to help customers prepare for their driver’s license tests through online practice, lesson scheduling, and training packages. The system also needed features for employees and administrators to manage customers and lessons. 

### One thing I did well was identifying the system requirements and organizing the features the system needed. I also think my diagrams helped show how users interact with the system and how different parts connect. 

### If I could revise one part, I would improve my diagrams by adding more detail and making them easier to understand. Clearer explanations would make it easier for others to follow the design. I focused on user needs by thinking about what customers and employees needed the system to do. This is important because a system has to be useful and easy to use in order to be successful.

### When designing software, I usually start by understanding the problem and breaking it into smaller parts. In the future, I would continue using techniques like requirements analysis and UML diagrams to help organize and improve my designs.
